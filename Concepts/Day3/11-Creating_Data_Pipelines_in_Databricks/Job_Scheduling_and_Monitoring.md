# 1.2 Job Scheduling and Monitoring

Databricks provides scheduling and monitoring capabilities to automate data workflows and ensure their reliability.

## Setting Up Job Scheduling
1. **Databricks Job Scheduling**:
   - Schedule jobs to run at specific times or frequencies.
   - **Example**: Schedule a job to process data daily at midnight.

2. **Code Example**:
   ```python
   job_id = dbutils.jobs.submitRun(
       job_name="Daily Sales Processing",
       new_cluster={
           "spark_version": "10.4.x-scala2.12",
           "node_type_id": "i3.xlarge",
           "num_workers": 2
       },
       notebook_task={
           "notebook_path": "/Users/user@example.com/sales_processing"
       }
   )
   ```

## Monitoring Pipelines
1. **Job Status and Alerts**:
   - Monitor job statuses in the Databricks UI and set up alerts for failures.
   - **Example**: Send email alerts when a job fails to notify the team.

2. **Real-time Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use Spark UI to track resource usage and optimize performance.
   - **Scenario**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to identify bottlenecks in the pipeline.

## Best Practices for Scheduling and Monitoring
1. **Configure Retries**:
   - Set up retries for jobs to increase reliability in case of intermittent failures.
2. **Enable Logging**:
   - Use logging for debugging and monitoring job performance over time.
