# 1.1 Using Databricks Pipelines for Data Workflows

Databricks allows users to build and manage data pipelines, handling everything from data ingestion to transformation and output.

## Key Components of a Databricks Pipeline
1. **Data Sources**:
   - Pipelines start by connecting to data sources such as S3, databases, or APIs.
   - **Example**: Ingest raw sales data from S3 for processing.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Apply transformations like filtering, aggregations, and data cleaning.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     df = spark.read.json("s3a://your-bucket-name/sales-data.json")
     transformed_df = df.filter(df['quantity'] > 0).groupBy("product").sum("amount")
     ```

3. **Data Load**:
   - Load transformed data into destinations such as Delta Lake, Redshift, or a reporting database.
   - **Example**: Store the transformed data in Delta Lake for further analytics.
     ```python
     transformed_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/delta/sales_summary")
     ```

## Best Practices for Databricks Pipelines
1. **Modularize Steps**:
   - Separate each stage in the pipeline for reusability.
2. **Use Delta Lake for Reliability**:
   - Utilize Delta Lake as an intermediate storage to ensure data consistency.
3. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - Use try-except blocks and data validation to manage pipeline failures.
