# 1.2 Monitoring and Optimizing Pipeline Performance

To ensure the pipeline remains performant, it's crucial to monitor data flows and optimize for low-latency, high-throughput processing.

## Key Monitoring Techniques
1. **Real-Time Monitoring with Databricks**:
   - Use the Spark UI and Delta Lake metrics to monitor data ingestion and processing rates.
   - **Example**: Track input rows per second to identify any bottlenecks.

2. **Setting Up Alerts**:
   - Configure alerts for errors or latency spikes to quickly respond to performance issues.
   - **Scenario**: Alert the engineering team if latency exceeds 500ms in transaction processing.

## Optimization Techniques
1. **Partitioning and Parallelism**:
   - Optimize performance by adjusting partition sizes and parallelism for high-throughput streams.
   - **Example**: Set `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` to a higher value for improved streaming performance.

2. **Checkpointing for Data Consistency**:
   - Use checkpoints in Delta Lake to ensure exactly-once processing and recovery on failures.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     kafka_df.writeStream.format("delta").option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint").start()
     ```

3. **Using Delta Cache**:
   - Enable Delta Cache to improve read speeds for frequently accessed data.
