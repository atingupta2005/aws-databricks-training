# 1.1 Building a Real-Time Data Pipeline Using Kafka and Delta Live Tables

A real-time data pipeline for financial data must be reliable, low-latency, and able to process high-frequency transactions. Integrating Apache Kafka with Delta Live Tables on Databricks enables this by streaming data continuously and storing it in Delta Lake.

## Key Components of the Pipeline
1. **Apache Kafka**:
   - Kafka acts as the message broker, streaming data from financial systems to Databricks.
   - **Example**: Use Kafka to stream transaction data, such as trades, in real-time.

2. **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**:
   - DLT helps manage and transform streaming data as it flows through the pipeline.
   - **Use Case**: Apply real-time data transformations like aggregation and filtering on incoming transactions.

## Hands-on Example with Kafka and DLT
1. **Setting Up Kafka Stream**:
   ```python
   kafka_options = {
       "kafka.bootstrap.servers": "broker1:9092,broker2:9092",
       "subscribe": "financial-transactions"
   }
   kafka_df = spark.readStream.format("kafka").options(**kafka_options).load()
   ```

2. **Creating Delta Live Tables for Streaming Data**:
   ```python
   @dlt.table
   def transaction_data():
       return kafka_df.selectExpr("CAST(key AS STRING)", "CAST(value AS STRING)")

   @dlt.table
   def aggregated_transactions():
       return dlt.read("transaction_data").groupBy("account_id").sum("amount")
   ```

3. **Real-World Scenario**:
   - **Scenario**: A financial institution monitors stock trades in real-time, calculating daily transaction volumes per account.
