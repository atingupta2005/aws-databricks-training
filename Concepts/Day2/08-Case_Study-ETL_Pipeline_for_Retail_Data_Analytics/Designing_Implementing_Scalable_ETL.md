# 1.1 Designing and Implementing a Scalable ETL Pipeline on Databricks

## ETL Pipeline Architecture
An ETL pipeline for retail data typically involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and loading it into a target system for analytics.

### Key Stages of the ETL Pipeline
1. **Extract**:
   - **Sources**: Retail data may come from multiple sources such as transactional databases, inventory systems, and customer databases.
   - **Data Extraction**: Use Databricks to connect to AWS data sources (e.g., S3, RDS) and ingest data.
   - **Example**: Extract daily sales data from S3 and customer demographics from an RDS database.

2. **Transform**:
   - **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Process raw data to remove inconsistencies and transform it for analysis.
   - **Tools**: Use Databricks with Apache Spark for batch and real-time transformations.
   - **Example**: Standardize product categories and calculate key metrics like average order value.

3. **Load**:
   - **Data Loading**: Load transformed data into an analytics-friendly storage format.
   - **Targets**: Common targets include Delta Lake on Databricks for versioned storage or Redshift for reporting.
   - **Example**: Load cleaned sales and inventory data into Delta Lake tables for consistent reporting.
