# 1.2 Leveraging AWS Services and Delta Lake for Data Integrity

AWS services and Delta Lake provide critical support for maintaining data integrity throughout the ETL pipeline.

## AWS Services for Data Management
1. **Amazon S3 for Data Storage**:
   - S3 serves as the primary storage for raw retail data, offering scalability and durability.
   - **Example**: Daily transaction logs are stored in S3, from where they are loaded into Databricks for processing.

2. **AWS Glue for Data Cataloging**:
   - Glue Data Catalog organizes metadata, making data more accessible and traceable within Databricks.
   - **Example**: Register tables in Glue to streamline data discovery and access within Databricks.

## Delta Lake for Data Integrity
1. **ACID Transactions**:
   - Delta Lake supports ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency during ETL operations.
   - **Example**: An ETL job can update Delta Lake tables without risking partial updates in case of failure.

2. **Schema Enforcement**:
   - Enforce schema consistency across incoming data, preventing errors from inconsistent fields.
   - **Use Case**: A retail organization maintains a strict schema for its sales data, preventing schema mismatches.

3. **Time Travel and Data Auditing**:
   - Delta Lake’s time travel allows access to historical data, which is useful for audits and understanding trends.
   - **Example**: Analysts can revert to last week’s data to verify changes and ensure data accuracy.
