# 1.2 Integrating with AWS Step Functions for Complex Workflows

## Overview of AWS Step Functions Integration
AWS Step Functions is an orchestration service that allows users to define complex workflows and control dependencies across tasks.

### Steps to Integrate Databricks with Step Functions
1. **Create a Lambda Function to Trigger Databricks Jobs**:
   - Use AWS Lambda to initiate Databricks jobs by calling the Databricks REST API.
   - **Example**: A Lambda function is triggered when new data lands in S3, which then starts a Databricks job to process the data.

2. **Define Workflow in Step Functions**:
   - Use Step Functions to define a state machine where each state represents a task in the workflow.
   - **Use Case**: A data pipeline that includes tasks like data ingestion, transformation, and loading to a data warehouse.

3. **Error Handling and Retries**:
   - Step Functions allows for configuring retries and error-handling rules to improve the reliability of workflows.
   - **Example**: Define retry policies for Databricks job failures within the Step Functions workflow.

## Best Practices for Integrating Step Functions
1. **Modularize Tasks in Step Functions**:
   - Define each major task (e.g., ETL, ML training) as a separate step for flexibility.
2. **Implement Error Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Use Step Functions to retry failed steps or send alerts for manual intervention.
