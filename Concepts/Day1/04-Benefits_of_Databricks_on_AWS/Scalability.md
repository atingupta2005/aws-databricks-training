## Overview of Scalability Benefits
Databricks on AWS allows seamless scaling of resources to meet workload demands, whether handling large datasets or complex computations.

### Key Advantages
1. **Auto-scaling Clusters**:
   - Databricks automatically adjusts cluster resources based on the workload, adding or removing nodes as necessary.
   - **Use Case**: A media company processes terabytes of real-time video data using auto-scaling clusters that expand as data volume spikes.

2. **Elastic Compute Resources**:
   - AWS offers virtually unlimited compute and storage, enabling Databricks to handle massive datasets without performance bottlenecks.
   - **Example**: During peak business hours, a retail company scales up its Databricks clusters to process transaction data in real-time.
