# 1.1 Architecture Overview and Integration Points

## Architecture Overview
The Databricks architecture on AWS allows seamless integration with key AWS services, enhancing data processing capabilities and operational efficiency.

### Key Integration Points
1. **Amazon S3 for Data Storage**:
   - Databricks connects to Amazon S3 for scalable, durable data storage.
   - **Example**: Raw data is stored in S3, processed in Databricks, and written back to S3 for storage and analysis.

2. **AWS Glue for Data Cataloging**:
   - Glue Data Catalog integrates with Databricks to organize and manage metadata.
   - **Use Case**: A retail company catalogs data in Glue, enabling Databricks to query organized data efficiently.

3. **Amazon Redshift for Data Warehousing**:
   - Redshift serves as a high-performance data warehouse, where Databricks can push processed data for BI.
   - **Example**: ETL jobs in Databricks aggregate and clean data before loading it into Redshift for analytics.

4. **AWS Lambda for Workflow Automation**:
   - Lambda functions automate and trigger specific Databricks jobs, streamlining workflows.
   - **Scenario**: New data landing in S3 triggers a Lambda function that starts a data transformation job in Databricks.

5. **AWS Step Functions for Orchestration**:
   - Step Functions provide workflow orchestration, coordinating complex tasks.
   - **Use Case**: Databricks and other AWS services like S3 and Redshift are part of an automated data pipeline managed by Step Functions.
