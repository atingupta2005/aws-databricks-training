# 1.3 Databricks on AWS Architecture

When deployed on AWS, Databricks leverages various AWS services, such as S3, Redshift, and IAM, to provide high scalability, security, and integration.

## Key Components
- **Databricks Clusters**: Managed, elastic Spark clusters optimized for big data.
- **Data Storage**: Delta Lake on AWS S3 adds data reliability and ACID transactions.
- **Security**: AWS IAM and VPCs provide robust security and network isolation.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions and Lambda support complex data workflows.
