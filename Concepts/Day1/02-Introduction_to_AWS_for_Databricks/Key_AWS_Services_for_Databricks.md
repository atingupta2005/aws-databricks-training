# 1.2 Key AWS Services Relevant to Databricks

AWS provides numerous services that enhance Databricksâ€™ capabilities, supporting data storage, security, and processing.

### Essential AWS Services
1. **Amazon S3**:
   - S3 serves as a scalable storage solution for raw, processed, and archived data.
   - **Use Case**: Databricks reads raw data from S3, processes it, and writes the output back for storage.

2. **Amazon Redshift**:
   - Redshift is an ideal data warehousing solution for analytics, enabling rapid querying of large datasets.
   - **Example**: Databricks processes data and loads it into Redshift, making it available for business intelligence applications.

3. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**:
   - IAM enables fine-grained access control, ensuring data security and compliance.
   - **Scenario**: Access to Databricks clusters is restricted to specific roles using IAM policies.

4. **AWS Lambda**:
   - Lambda functions can trigger Databricks jobs, orchestrating workflows without provisioning servers.
   - **Example**: A Lambda function initiates a Databricks ETL job whenever new data lands in S3.
