## Benefits of Using AWS with Databricks
AWS infrastructure provides various benefits that enhance Databricks' performance and functionality.

### Key Benefits
1. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
   - AWS offers virtually limitless compute and storage resources, scaling with Databricks workloads.
   - **Example**: A data science team can scale Databricks clusters on AWS to handle large datasets without hitting infrastructure limits.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing and spot instance options help reduce costs for Databricks users.
   - **Use Case**: Running transient Databricks clusters on AWS spot instances for ETL workloads, minimizing operational costs.

3. **Comprehensive Security**:
   - AWS IAM, VPCs, and data encryption options provide secure environments for data processing.
